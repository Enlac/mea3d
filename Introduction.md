# Introduction #

mea3D is a 3D engine written in Javascript. All the 3D stuff is **pure HTML5**, mea3D uses no Flash, no Silverlight, no DirectX or no OpenGL.

The engine supports the following:
  * Transformations
  * Lighting
  * Loading custom 3D models and meshes (in JSON format)
  * Raytracing
